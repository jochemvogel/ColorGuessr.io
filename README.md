ColorGuessr is a game for the real designerds. A color space (hsl, rgb and/or hex) will be given and it's up to you to choose the circle with the right color. The higher the level, the more points you get. But be careful, you've three lifes.

The current levels are:
- Easy (3 circles)
- Medium (6 circles)
- Hard (9 circles)
- Impossible (21 circles)

## Future features:

### - Highscore:
Add the highScore to localStorage, so user can beat their own score

### - Lifes
The lifes functionality is already added to the game, but I'd like to add hearts instead of a number to show the amount of lifes left.
